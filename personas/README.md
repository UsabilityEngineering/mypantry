## Geoffrey
![](Geoffrey.jpeg)
42 year old married man living in Pierre, South Dakota. Invested in BitCoin early in its life and cashed out in 2020, retiring early in his life from his job as an accountant. Geoffrey has two children: a 12 year old son and 9 year old daughter. 
Having a ton of free time on his hands, Geoffrey has been seeking out new hobbies and is currently bouncing around between different hobbies until he finds one that sticks.
Geoffrey’s wife insists that she continue working her job, despite his immense fortune. That doesn’t bother Geoffrey. He quite likes taking care of the home while his wife is out. That includes doing the cooking, although his family has been quite vocal about their unhappiness with his bland meals.
### Goals:
* Find recipes that better appeal to his children's appetites.
* Able to quickly find his missing ingredients for the meals he'd like to cook.

## Trey

Trey is a 20 year old man, full time college student at Arizona State University majoring in English. His day to day experience involves going to school, doing homework assignments, playing video games and hanging out with friends. He lives in an apartment with three other roommates.
He wants to learn how to cook, but feels like he often does not have the time to do so. He often resorts to using delivery apps such as Doordash and UberEats for dinner, but certain foods have been giving his stomach a rough time.
### Goals:
* Easy to learn recipes with relatively simple ingredients.
* Find food components that are making his stomach upset.

## Destiny

Destiny is a 20 year old female living in Los Angeles County. She doesn’t quite like cleaning, and her house would be considered to be quite messy even by college dorm standards. She loves to cook and the kitchen, in a similar theme to the rest of her house, has a smorgasbord of ingredients strewn throughout.

She has been single the majority of her life, but doesn’t particularly care about that. She enjoys being on her own. She has a couple of close friends she loves and no ambition to be a social butterfly.
She loves trying new things, but lately has had trouble finding new things to try.
### Goals:
* Wants to find new recipes she can experiment with.

## Julie

Julie is an accountant and mother of three living in Georgia. Her husband is in the military and there are long periods of time where she is solely responsible for their children. Julie’s job fluctuates in demand with some weeks where she is extremely busy and others where she may have some more free time on her hands.

In regards to meals, if she had the time, Julie would prefer to cook a healthy meal. Her youngest son has a lot of food allergies, however, so finding new meals that are healthy with a limited amount of ingredients has proven to be a challenge.

### Goals:
* Wants a list of healthy meals with the dietary restrictions

# Scenarios
## Geoffrey’s Home Life
Even though Geoffrey's wallets are overflowing with bitcoin, and his luck beyond human comprehension, his kids absolutely abhor his cooking. Geoffrey isn't concerned about cooking with the ingredients he has immediately on hand, as he has the free time to go grocery shopping every week, but he wants to at least be able to more easily know what he needs to buy once he's figured out what he will be cooking throughout the week.

## Chef Geoffrey
For the second time this week, Geoffrey was making Kraft mac n cheese for the kids. Unfortunately for our beloved stay at home father, his children have the refined taste of their mother, and are rapidly approaching an age where more eccentric culinary dinner delights are demanded.

## Stomach vs. Trey
After another night of sitting on the toilet despite not having had any Taco Bell lately, Trey consulted his doctor and was instructed to keep a food journal to help him find out foods he should avoid. Trey, however, is pretty picky, and wants to instead find out what ingredients he should avoid so he can find alternative recipes for the same food he loves.

## Julie's Guilt
Julie's kids love fast food nights, but every time she pulls through the drive through, she has a moment of guilt followed by the thought "am I an abuser for getting fast food so often for these kids?" She wants to try to start cooking for her kids and providing them with healthy meals.

## Out of Ideas
Destiny loves cooking for her close friend group but has been running out of ideas for recipes to make. She might also be considering cleaning her house and by extension her kitchen as a French transfer student in her health sciences class has caught her eye. She believes that using her existing ingredients would be one of the best ways to clean up some of the mess.
