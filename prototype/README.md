# MyPantry Prototype

The MyPantry prototype used in the usability tests is a Django-based web application that was created by the UX team. We chose to use Django when making our prototype because we were not satisfied by the limitations on our insights that an AdobeXD prototype would have imposed. We believed that the best insights to be gained would be from user interactions with a "simulation" of the product.

## Home Page

For the design of our prototype, we omitted the extra step of having a user login to an account. We did this because it would have been more difficult to implement a prototype that could handle unique users, and because no useful usability insights were to be gained by having a user login as they are used exhaustively on most web applications.
