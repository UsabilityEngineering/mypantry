# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

In many households, regardless of any size, there are two common problems that tend to arise:
1. Organization of food and ingredients in the household.
2. Determining what to eat, when to eat it, and how to prepare it.

The team for **MyPantry** has performed some analysis and evaluated that there exists an opportunity to improve user experience by **providing a unified solution** to these problems.

* The market for an app like ours is **highly satured, but limited in scope**. Our competitive analysis provided us with the following **user insights**:
    * Users would like to create their own recipes.
    * Users would like a product that is **cross-platfrom**.
* When evaluation a specific competitor, **SuperCook**, it was found thaat the product was generally easy to use, however it lacked **error reporting** and **documentation**.
* More information about what is desired of our application have been envisioned through new personas and scenarios:
    * The desire for an application with a high degree of **user freedom** in the form of niche filters and features.
* We were also able to apply insights gained from findings to our sketches and diagrams:
    * **Increasing learnability** by including a getting started pop-up.
    * **Clarifying system status** by separating different tasks and notifying the users of errors.
    * **Increasing user efficiency** by adding shortcuts for experienced users.
