# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

In many households, regardless of any size, there are two common problems that tend to arise:
1. Organization of food and ingredients in the household.
2. Determining what to eat, when to eat it, and how to prepare it.

The team for **MyPantry** has performed some analysis and evaluated that there exists an opportunity to improve user experience by **providing a unified solution** to these problems.

* The market for an app like ours is **highly satured, but limited in scope**. Our competitive analysis provided us with the following **user insights**:
    * Users would like to create their own recipes.
    * Users would like a product that is **cross-platfrom**.
* When evaluation a specific competitor, **SuperCook**, it was found thaat the product was generally easy to use, however it lacked **error reporting** and **documentation**.
* More information about what is desired of our application have been envisioned through new personas and scenarios:
    * The desire for an application with a high degree of **user freedom** in the form of niche filters and features.
* We were also able to apply insights gained from findings to our sketches and diagrams:
    * **Increasing learnability** by including a getting started pop-up.
    * **Clarifying system status** by separating different tasks and notifying the users of errors.
    * **Increasing user efficiency** by adding shortcuts for experienced users.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

Using insights gained from phase I, the team for **MyPantry** has designed wireframes with the goals of **increased versatility** compared to current competitors in the field.

The team has performed more analysis and evaluated that our original vision was too broad, and we have given **new clarity to the direction** of the product.

* A need for a new **major feature** was determined through informal user feedback: 
    * The combination of a food journal and recipe catalog is a new space in the market with **little to no notable competition**.
    * There is a demand for this service.
* Cognitive walkthroughs provided usability insights for improving wireframes:
    * Feedback reinforced the need to **narrow the scope** of our product.
        * The ability for users to label ingredients as belonging to a specific person was scrapped.
    * The current design does a good job of directing the user through their interaction.
* With this new **direction** for our product in mind, we have adjusted our personas and scenarios accordingly:
    * Geoffrey and Trey have had their personas changed.
    * User story "Trey's Roomate Situation" was removed.
    * User story "Stomach vs. Trey" was changed.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

Using insights gained in both phases I and II, the team for **MyPantry** designed and ran a usability test on a prototype of the web app in order to further improve the **user experience** of the product.

* To improve **clarity**, tabs will be renamed to emphasize their purpose.
    * "Pantry" tab will be renamed "Ingredients".
* Documentation for the app will be separated out from the carousel on the "Home" page.
    * This will improve **learnability**, allowing the user to understand how the product works prior to using it.

Suggestions from the participants of the study have also influenced our design changes.
* "Food Diary" will be completely redesigned to be a timeline.
    * Users will add recipes or notes directly to this timeline.
* The "Recipe Creation Form" will undergo a UI redesign to make certain buttons more **salient**.
* "Browse Recipes" will undergo a UI redesign to improve clarity on what filters do and what their current status is.
* The "Grocery List" page will receive a couple additional features:
    * The ability to have missing ingredients presented in a list format.
    * The ability to import all missing ingredients into a user's pantry.

The study also revealed that the most liked features were the "Grocery List" and "Food Diary," indicating that the change in direction in the previous phase was necessary to differentiate our product.
