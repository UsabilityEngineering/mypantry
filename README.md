# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

In many households, regardless of any size, there are two common problems that tend to arise:
1. Organization of food and ingredients in the household.
2. Determining what to eat, when to eat it, and how to prepare it.

The team for **MyPantry** has performed some analysis and evaluated that there exists an opportunity to improve user experience by **providing a unified solution** to these problems.

* The market for an app like ours is **highly satured, but limited in scope**. Our competitive analysis provided us with the following **user insights**:
    * Users would like to create their own recipes.
    * Users would like a product that is **cross-platfrom**.
* When evaluation a specific competitor, **SuperCook**, it was found thaat the product was generally easy to use, however it lacked **error reporting** and **documentation**.
* More information about what is desired of our application have been envisioned through new personas and scenarios:
    * The desire for an application with a high degree of **user freedom** in the form of niche filters and features.
* We were also able to apply insights gained from findings to our sketches and diagrams:
    * **Increasing learnability** by including a getting started pop-up.
    * **Clarifying system status** by separating different tasks and notifying the users of errors.
    * **Increasing user efficiency** by adding shortcuts for experienced users.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

Using insights gained from phase I, the team for **MyPantry** has designed wireframes with the goals of **increased versatility** compared to current competitors in the field.

The team has performed more analysis and evaluated that our original vision was too broad, and we have given **new clarity to the direction** of the product.

* A need for a new **major feature** was determined through informal user feedback: 
    * The combination of a food journal and recipe catalog is a new space in the market with **little to no notable competition**.
    * There is a demand for this service.
* Cognitive walkthroughs provided usability insights for improving wireframes:
    * Feedback reinforced the need to **narrow the scope** of our product.
        * The ability for users to label ingredients as belonging to a specific person was scrapped.
    * The current design does a good job of directing the user through their interaction.
* With this new **direction** for our product in mind, we have adjusted our personas and scenarios accordingly:
    * Geoffrey and Trey have had their personas changed.
    * User story "Trey's Roomate Situation" was removed.
    * User story "Stomach vs. Trey" was changed.
